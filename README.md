# eleco-template
This reporsitory provides a Latex template for
[International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)](http://www.eleco.org.tr).
In 2023, the conference initially provided only an MS Word template to help authors meet their
[formatting guidelines](http://www.eleco.org.tr/authors.htm).
In previous years (e.g. 2017) a Latex template had been provided for the conference, but it did not
meet the current formatting guidelines. This new Latex template was therefore developed. The MS Word
template was converted to Latex.

Formatting configuration is mainly encapsulated into the `eleco.sty` file. The main `.tex` file includes
this package and adds any additional paper-specific packages. The class `extarticle` is used with the `9pt`
class option to get 9pt size for the main body font.

If you are using this template and style file and find any problems or have suggestions for improvements,
please submit an issue on Github.
